# Bet_European_Soccer
In this repo I analyzed odds from 2005 to 2015 held on European soccer national league games. 
In the Branch "master" we have the test and analysis. The branch "Dados" is for the already treated data, and "Code" is for the Sqlite Database and the code which produced the treated data.

I started the analysis with a question in mind: Betting on favourites would be a good betting technic? Well, then, who's favourite? 
I setted a criteria based os the historical odds of winning teams. The team which has never had odd bigger than 6.5 for winning is a favourite. Our list of teams reduced from 200+ to 19.

So, what if we had always bet $100 in the favourite squad? The graph below show us the cumulative result. 

# Vamos ver como fica uma soma acumulada das apostas na vitoria do "favorito"
