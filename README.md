# Bet_European_Soccer
In this repo I analyzed odds from 2005 to 2015 held on European soccer national league games. 
In the Branch "master" we have the test and analysis. The branch "Dados" is for the already treated data, and "Code" is for the Sqlite Database and the code which produced the treated data.
